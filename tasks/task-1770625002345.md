The color palette is designed to evoke trust, sophistication, and a modern retail experience. Professional placeholder images will be used, so the colors should be versatile enough to complement various product types within the retail sector.

    *   **Hex:** `#007bff` (Bright, energetic blue) - Evokes trust, reliability, and professionalism. A classic choice for retail that signifies quality.
    *   **Gradient Recommendation:** A subtle linear gradient from `#007bff` (start) to `#0056b3` (end) for key headers and CTAs. This adds depth and a premium feel.

*   **Accent Color (Highlight & Call-to-Action):**
    *   **Hex:** `#ffc107` (Golden Yellow/Amber) - Draws attention, signifies value, and creates a sense of excitement and urgency. Ideal for CTAs.

*   **Neutral Colors (Background & Text):**
    *   **Background (Light):** `#f8f9fa` (Off-white/Very Light Gray) - Clean, modern, and allows content to pop.
    *   **Background (Darker for contrast):** `#e9ecef` (Light Gray) - Used for dividing sections or creating subtle contrast.
    *   **Text (Primary):** `#343a40` (Dark Gray) - Highly readable for body text.
    *   **Text (Secondary/Subtle):** `#6c757d` (Medium Gray) - For secondary information, captions, or disabled states.

### 3. HERO SECTION

The first impression is critical. This section will be visually striking and immediately communicate the core value proposition of Test Business.

*   **Compelling Headline:** **"Discover Quality. Experience Excellence. Shop Smarter."**
    *   **Font:** Poppins Bold
    *   **Color:** `#ffffff` (White) for maximum contrast against the background.

*   **Subheadline with Value Proposition:** **"Your curated destination for premium retail goods, offering unparalleled value and exceptional customer service. Find exactly what you need, with a seamless shopping journey."**
    *   **Font:** Open Sans Regular
    *   **Color:** `#ffffff` (White) or a slightly desaturated white (`#f0f0f0`) for a softer effect.

*   **Call-to-Action Button Text:** **"Explore Our Collection"**
    *   **Font:** Poppins SemiBold
    *   **Color:** `#343a40` (Dark Gray) for text contrast on the button.
    *   **Background:** Gradient from `#ffc107` to `#e0a800` (Accent Color gradient).
    *   **Hover Effect:** Subtle darkening of the gradient or a slight lift/shadow.

*   **Background Style:** **Dynamic Gradient with Subtle Overlay**
    *   **Gradient:** A smooth, linear gradient starting from a deep, rich version of the Primary Color (`#0056b3`) at the top fading to a lighter, aspirational shade (`#007bff`).
    *   **Overlay:** A very subtle, abstract geometric pattern (e.g., delicate lines or dots) with low opacity (e.g., 5-10%) in a slightly darker shade than the background gradient. This adds visual interest without distracting from the text and CTA.
    *   **Image Integration (Optional/Conditional):** If a specific product category is to be highlighted, a high-quality, professional placeholder image could be used as a background, with the gradient overlayed on top to ensure text readability. The image should be aspirational and relevant to the retail category.

### 9. ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS

Animations will be subtle, sophisticated, and serve to guide the user's eye and enhance engagement, not distract.

*   **Entrance Animations (Section-wise):**
    *   **Hero Section:** Content (Headline, Subheadline, CTA) fades in with a slight upward slide upon page load.
    *   **About Section:**
        *   Owner's image fades in.
        *   Text content slides in from the side (right for the text column).
    *   **Services/Products Section:** Cards animate in one by one or in staggered rows using a "stagger" effect, fading in and slightly scaling up.
    *   **Photo Gallery:** Images appear with a subtle fade-in and slight zoom-in effect as they enter the viewport.
    *   **Contact Section:** Form fields and map subtly fade in.

*   **Hover Effects:**
    *   **Buttons (All CTAs):**
        *   Slight scale-up effect (e.g., `transform: scale(1.05)`).
        *   Subtle background color change or intensification of the gradient.
        *   Brief shadow lift.
    *   **Cards (Services/Products):**
        *   Subtle lift with a more pronounced shadow on hover (`box-shadow: 0px 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`).
        *   Slight scale-up.
    *   **Social Media Icons:** Subtle color change or slight bounce animation.
    *   **Navigation Links:** Underline animation that draws out from the center or left.

*   **Scroll-Triggered Reveals:**
    *   Sections should animate into view as the user scrolls down the page. The animation should be smooth and not jarring.
    *   Elements within sections (e.g., images, text blocks) can also be configured to animate in as they become visible.

*   **Micro-interactions for Engagement:**
    *   **Form Field Focus:** Input border color changes smoothly to the accent color.
    *   **Button Click:** A subtle "press" animation on click.
    *   **Image Zoom on Hover (Gallery):** A slight, gentle zoom effect on images in the gallery on hover before click.
    *   **Navigation Highlight:** Active navigation link gets a subtle persistent glow or color change.

**Animation Libraries:** Consider using libraries like GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), AOS (Animate On Scroll), or CSS-native animations where appropriate for performance and maintainability. Animations should be optimized for smooth performance on all devices.

### 10. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS

The website must be fully responsive and deliver an exceptional experience on all devices.

*   **Breakpoint Considerations:**
    *   **Mobile:** Max-width: 767px
    *   **Tablet:** Min-width: 768px and Max-width: 991px
    *   **Desktop:** Min-width: 992px
    *   **Large Desktop:** Min-width: 1200px (for richer layouts if needed, though standard desktop is sufficient)

*   **Layout Adjustments:**
    *   **Navigation:** Collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile/tablet.
    *   **Hero Section:** Text and CTA stack vertically and font sizes adjust for optimal readability.
    *   **Two-Column Layouts (About, Contact):** Stack vertically on mobile and tablet, with the left column appearing above the right.
    *   **Card Grids (Services/Products):** Adjust number of columns as described in Section 5.
    *   **Photo Gallery:** Adjust number of columns and image size.
    *   **Footer:** Columns stack vertically on mobile.

*   **Touch-Friendly Elements:**
    *   **Button Sizes:** Ensure all tappable areas (buttons, links, icons) are at least 44x44 pixels to prevent accidental mis-taps.
    *   **Form Fields:** Adequate spacing between fields, clear labels, and appropriate input types (e.g., `tel` for phone numbers).
    *   **Gallery Navigation:** Arrows in lightbox must be large enough to tap easily.

*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Image Optimization:** Use responsive images (`<picture>` element or `srcset`) and compressed image formats (WebP).
    *   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images (especially in the gallery) to improve initial page load times.
    *   **Font Loading:** Optimize font loading strategies to prevent render-blocking.
    *   **Minification:** Minify CSS and JavaScript files.
